Documentation for hardcoded anticheat check names

---AAC 4---

C3 (T2) Autoclicker <- Legit flags (fluctuating CPS)

A5 (T3) -> Suspiciously Rotating (Your pitch doesnt move, while your yaw speed is over an hardcode value) (just randomize ur pitch)

A2 (T2) -> Wrong GCD (Greatest common divisor) aka, Fix your rotations and check the minecraft code to fix lmao

Move flags -> (Predicted movement with your rotations doesnt match their predicted movement, Velocity prediction, highjump, y/xz Modifiers, Strafe etc)

Timer flags -> (Moved too fast over a specific time, ex Having an velocity that bypasses their movement checks, but having an too average move balance etc)
